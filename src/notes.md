- need hashmap of discord user ID's and WG auth ID's 
    - get from DM of auth

- auth steps:
    - send user DM with WG auth link 
    - user opens DM 
    - logs in
    - wg sends information to redirect uri (ip/port of server)
    - thread listening on port that makes association with Discord/WG Auth ID's
        - redirect ID is this port on this IP
            - security nightmare, don't get your router popped lmao
            - what if in theory we had a DNS name??!
                - doesn't work, still traceable
                    - idfk hopefully mozzy never makes it back in fines 
                        - wait I agreed to host this piece of shit 
                            - Duangla I changed my mind :|
